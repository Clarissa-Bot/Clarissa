Q: Can I use this for my own app? A: Sure! We've got it open source for a reason!

Q: Is this a finished product? A: No. Much like Minecraft, this project is and will always be in beta mode.

Q: What is the project's goal? A: The goal is to add machine learning to a python bot. This has never been done before. We plan on having it be able to determine the next president by 2020. That feature will be deactivated by default until voting time.

# Current version
We are on version 1.1.6

# What's new?
TTS was disabled permanently until we find a way to use other alternatives. We also removed the use of .ini files, so please re-run setup.py. We also added more commands to be used by developers in their own CApps (Clarissa Apps).

# What will be in the next version?
We will continue to add to the corpus. We will also add some more developer friendly commands and functions. Miht even create a user interface.
