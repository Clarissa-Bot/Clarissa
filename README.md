# Clarissa

Clarissa is a python-based bot for PCs & Mobile phones.

# How to run?

If it's your first time, run 'python setup.py [SETUP_PATH]'. Example: 'python setup.py pwd'.

#  Q&A

Q: What is the end goal? A: The end goal is to allow commercial use of a mockup of IBM's Watson.

Q: Can I use this for my own app? A: Sure! We've got it open source for a reason!

Q: Is this a finished product? A: No. Much like Minecraft, this project is and will always be in beta mode.

Q: What is the project's goal? A: The goal is to add machine learning to a python bot. This has never been done before. We plan on having it be able to determine the next president by 2020. That feature will be deactivated by default until voting time.

# Current version
We are on version 1.1.4

# What's new?
I finally added support for custom responses from chatterbot. For efficiency's sake, it also uploads the response to the server with the command.

# What will be in the next version?
I will be teaming up with another software developer to hopefully get this project some traction.
