# How to run?

If it's your first time, run 'python setup.py [SETUP_PATH]'. Example: 'python setup.py pwd'.

#  Q&A

Q: What is the end goal? A: The end goal is to allow commercial use of a mockup of IBM's Watson.

Q: Can I use this for my own app? A: Sure! We've got it open source for a reason!

Q: Why do you need $10k? A: I need $10k to get some servers so I can host this online.

Q: Is this a finished product? A: No. Much like Minecraft, this project is and will always be in beta mode.

Q: What is the project's goal? A: The goal is to add machine learning to a python bot. This has never been done before. We plan on having it be able to determine the next president by 2020. That feature will be deactivated by default until voting time.

# Current version
We are on version 1.1.3

# What's new?
Well now we have beta support for voice-to-bot interaction (using your voice to talk to the bot). It's all in the help menu. Just run python bot.py --help. We also added text-to-speech for the bot. Again, its in beta. Also, we did some under-the-hood patches & future bug avoidances. Some fixes here and there. Not a major release, but loads of issues fixed.

# What will be in the next version?
Definetly a hotkey thing, like Google Assistant's "Okay Google", but to start up Clarissa. More than likely a more secure connection to the server. We will probably close source the connection.
