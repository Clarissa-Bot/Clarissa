# Why is this under Clarissa
We are starting to roll out pre-installed apps on Clarissa. Mostly games and beta applications, nothing too big.

# What is this game?
It's like Battleship, but based on a shooting scenario. Player one is the shooter, player two is the responding officer.

# What are the rules?
The only rules are to not share your position and to have fun!

Fact: The more you injure your enemy, the stronger you get,and the weaker they get.
The more the enemy injures you, the weaker you get, and the stronger they get.
The game ends when one of the players' strength is at ZERO.
You also get weaker if you miss the shot you make!
